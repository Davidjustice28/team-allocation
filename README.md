## Team Allocator Project - Beginner's Step By Step Coding Course Book 

Created a simple program that takes a list of players and randomly picks teams. The program also dictates who goes first. I did my best to make the **pick_teams** function reusable by allowing users to dictate how many teams to create and what players to choose from.

It's a simple project to demonstrate my understanding of variables, data types, loops, displaying and receiving input, creating functions, and many more basic python principles.
